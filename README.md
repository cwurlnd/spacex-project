# spacex-project

This is a data visualization project that I worked on in the Fall 2020 semester. 
The website is built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
Partnering with SpaceX, this website allows users to insert data about various vendors and creates custom visualizations about the data.
Further, there is an interactive tool that allows users to determine what field is most important to them (time, quality, and cost) and recommends the best vendors for that criteria.
